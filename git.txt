First, git init will help you run git.
Then, git status will help you figure out what needs to be pushed. 
Next, git add nameoffile.withextension will pick the file that needs to be added. 
Now, git commit -m "typeamessagehere" will finally add.
Finally, git push origin master will push to github. 
Do git status one last time to see which files in red still need to be commited. 
YA DONE.
